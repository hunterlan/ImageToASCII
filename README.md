Idea of project was taken from this video: [link](https://youtu.be/zC0gn8_GafI). However, what's the difference?

1. My project doesn't use Windows-only libraries. 
2. Break files onto projects. 


## What external libraries have been used?

- Magick.NET

## How to launch?

You have to pass two arguments:

1. Input path argument - this path points to your library. E.g: ./test/diamond_dogs.img
2. Output path argument - on this path you can find result of works. E.g: ./result/diamond_dogs.txt
